# Calculator-Advanced-Swift-iOS13
Simple calculator on Swift

This is the app I made learning iOS 13 & Swift 5 course by Angela Yu (https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp).


What I did learn making this app:

1. Difference between Structures and Classes
2. Internal/External Parameters
3. Access Levels
4. Using tuples in calculation methods
